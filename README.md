# Aircraft Recognition using Vision Transformer (ViT)

This project implements **aircraft recognition** using **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**, leveraging deep learning for fine-grained image classification. The system can accurately recognize over 100 different aircraft variants from the **FGVC Aircraft Dataset**.

Unlike conventional CNN-based methods, Vision Transformers process images as sequences of patches and utilize self-attention to capture both local and global dependencies. This results in improved accuracy and efficiency in classification tasks.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aircraft-recognition-vit.git
cd aircraft-recognition-vit
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main dependencies include:

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch / TensorFlow
* Hugging Face Transformers
* Flask (for app.py)

### 4. Download Dataset

Download the **FGVC Aircraft Dataset** and place it in the project directory:

```
dataset/
 â””â”€â”€ fgvc-aircraft-2013b/
      â”œâ”€â”€ images/
      â”œâ”€â”€ data/
```

### 5. Training (Optional)

If you want to train the model from scratch:

```bash
python vit.py
```

### 6. Running the App

After training or placing a pre-trained model inside `trained_aircraft_model/`, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to test the web interface.
